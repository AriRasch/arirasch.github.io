# About Me

I am a researcher at the [University of MÃ¼nster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/) in Germany. My work focuses on compiler technologies -- code generation and optimization -- as well as programming language design for parallel architectures, including GPUs and CPUs, based on formal methods. My overall research goal is to provide *Performance*, *Portability*, and *Productivity* for data-parallel computations with a particular focus on computations relevant for deep learning (e.g., linear algebra routines and stencil computations).

To achieve my goals, I am one of the main designers of a holistic code *Generation* & *Optimization* & *Execution* approach, consisting of three major sub-projects:

1. [Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDH)](https://mdh-lang.org), for *Code Generation* -- a novel algebraic formalism for expressing and reasoning formally about optimizations for data-parallel computations. In particular, this project includes the design and specification of a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for expressing data-parallel computations, as well as the design and implementation of a compiler for this DSL. Our compiler generates code (e.g., in CUDA, OpenMP, and OpenCL) that can be automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for contemporary parallel architectures.

2. [Auto-Tuning Framework (ATF)](https://atf-tuner.org), for *Code Optimization* -- a general-purpose auto-tuning approach that automatically optimizes parallel programs with constrained optimization parameters. For this, ATF introduces novel processes to generating, storing, and exploring the optimization spaces of constrained optimization parameters.

3. [Host Code Abstraction (HCA)](https://hca-project.org), for *Code Execution* -- a high-level programming abstraction that simplifies implementing and optimizing so-called host code which is required in modern parallel programming approaches (e.g., CUDA and OpenCL) to execute code on the devices of (potentially distributed) multi-device systems.
